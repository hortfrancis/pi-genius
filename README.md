# PiGenius

A website to help digital makers learn how to use Raspberry Pi microcomputers in fun physical computing projects, built using React, and deployed with GitHub Pages. 

This site is running live at: **[hortfrancis.github.io/pi-genius/](https://hortfrancis.github.io/pi-genius/)**

## Technologies used 

- React 
    - Function components
- Git
- GitHub
- Node 
    - npm (Node Package Manager)
- Linux
    - Bash (terminal)
- CSS
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code

## Deployment 

This project utilizes GitHub Pages to deploy the live, public site. Updating the `master` branch does not affect the live site. The live site is built and deployed from the `gh-pages` branch.

To update the live site with the latest code changes from the `master` branch, follow these steps using Bash (command line):

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Running these commands will sync the `gh-pages` branch and deploy the up-to-date site to [hortfrancis.github.io/pi-genius/](https://hortfrancis.github.io/pi-genius/).

## Visual design 

### Typography 

PiGenius employs the use of [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) and [Montserrat Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates) for typography. Custom webfonts are implemented using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
